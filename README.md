# Multi-Country-Web-App-Admin-Dashboard-UI-UX-Design-with-Figma
## Dashboard Home Screen
I designed a Full Admin Dashboard for a multi-country web application with five screens. I designed their UI and determined what to add and where to place it. The first screen is the overview or home base page of the dashboard, where the admin can view their revenue, promotion expenses, and revenue breakdown by country. In the dashboard, the admin can also see the best sellers in their business and total customer views on their page, as well as the average rating based on customer ratings received after order delivery.

## Dashboard's Products Screen
Page two is the product page, where an admin can add a new product and specify its attributes like category, name, quantity, price, photo SKU, description, and weight. In this module, shipping is based on the product's weight. On the same page, the admin can view all product details and search for them.

## Dashboard's Orders Screen
The third page is the orders page, where the admin can view all orders and add tracking numbers. This page is related to a shipping agency, where each order has two sets of information: the order summary, payment details, user information, and shipping details.

## Dashboard's Stock Screen
The fourth page is the stock page, where the admin can see all product categories. In each category, all products are listed with the available quantity in stock, the sold amount, and the remaining stock. Additionally, the admin can edit the amount of stock in each product.

## Dashboard's Messages Screen
Finally, the messages page is where all messages sent from the contact page on the website will be received, and the admin can reply to these messages.
